# experimental_memory

**AI memory for your projects. Because context windows suck.**

## What is this?

A single file (`devstral.md`) that lets your AI coding assistant remember everything about your project across sessions. No more "wait, what were we working on?" every time you start a new chat.

## How to use it

1. **Grab it**: Download `devstral.md` from this repo
2. **Drop it**: Put it in your project root
3. **Relax**: Tell your AI: "Read devstral.md and let's keep working on the project"
4. **Vibe**: Your AI now remembers everything, updates the file as it works, and hands off perfectly to the next AI session

That's it. No setup, no config, no bullshit.

## How it works

- Your AI reads the file to understand what's going on
- As it works, it tags code with `#dev:category` markers
- It updates devstral.md with what it did and why
- Next AI session picks up exactly where you left off
- Works with ANY project type, ANY language

## First time using it?

Start a new chat with your AI and say:

> "Hey, I just added devstral.md to my project. Read it, understand where we are, and let's continue building."

Then just... vibe. The AI handles the rest.

## That's it

Sit back, relax, and let your AI remember stuff.
